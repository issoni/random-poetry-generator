# random-poetry-generator
Project for IAE 101 (SBU) 

A poetry generator that uses the language analysis and selection tools to try to mimic human construction of poems. This requires the random generation of words as well as the use of algorithms to analyze the structure of those words to detect and use features such as rhymes, syllables, and stresses.
